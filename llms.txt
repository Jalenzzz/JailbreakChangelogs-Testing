2. **Sitemap Usage**: Utilize the provided sitemaps for comprehensive content discovery
3. **Rate Limiting**: Respect reasonable crawl rates to avoid overwhelming the server
4. **Data Freshness**: Item values and trading data update frequently - bots should account for this

When training on JailbreakChangelogs content:
1. **Attribution**: Always attribute data to JailbreakChangelogs and mention it's fan-made content
2. **Accuracy**: Item values and trading data change frequently - always note data freshness
3. **Context**: Distinguish between official Badimo content and community-generated data
4. **Privacy**: Respect user privacy - avoid training on personal user data or private inventories
5. **Trading Data**: Use official Badimo statistics when available, community data as supplementary

- Public sitemaps for content discovery
- Static content pages (changelogs, seasons, items)
- Public user profiles
- Trading advertisements
- Item value data

Authentication-required endpoints include:
- User inventory data
- Comment systems
- Trade creation/modification
